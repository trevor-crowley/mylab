%% QPSK Transmitter and Receiver in Simulink
% This model shows the implementation of a QPSK transmitter and receiver
% with Simulink. The receiver addresses practical issues in wireless
% communications, such as carrier frequency and phase offset, timing drift
% and frame synchronization. The receiver demodulates the received symbols
% and outputs a simple message to the Diagnostic Viewer. For the MATLAB
% implementation of the same system, refer to the

%% Overview
% This example model performs all processing at complex baseband to handle
% a static frequency offset, a timing drift, and Gaussian noise. To cope
% with the above-mentioned impairments, this example provides a reference
% design of a practical digital receiver, which includes correlation-based
% coarse frequency compensation, PLL-based fine frequency compensation,
% PLL-based symbol timing recovery, frame synchronization, and phase
% ambiguity resolution. The example showcases a few library blocks in
% Communications Toolbox(TM) that implement synchronization algorithms in
% the receiver processing.

%% Transmitter
% The transmitter includes the *Bit Generation* subsystem, the *QPSK
% Modulator* block, and the *Raised Cosine Transmit Filter* block. The *Bit
% Generation* subsystem uses a MATLAB workspace variable as the payload of
% a frame, as shown in the figure below. Each frame contains 20 'Hello
% world ###' messages and a header. The first 26 bits are header bits, a
% 13-bit Barker code that has been oversampled by two. The Barker code is
% oversampled by two in order to generate precisely 13 QPSK symbols for
% later use in the *Data Decoding* subsystem of the receiver model. The
% remaining bits are the payload. The payload correspond to the ASCII
% representation of 'Hello world ###', where '###' is a repeating sequence
% of '000', '001', '002', ..., '099'. The payload is scrambled to guarantee
% a balanced distribution of zeros and ones for the timing recovery
% operation in the receiver model. The scrambled bits are modulated by the
% *QPSK Modulator* (with Gray mapping). The modulated symbols are upsampled
% by two by the *Raised Cosine Transmit Filter* with a roll-off factor 0.5.
% The symbol rate of the transmitter system is 50k symbols per second, and
% the sample rate after the *Raised Cosine Transmit Filter* is 100k samples
% per second.

%% AWGN Channel with Frequency Offset and Variable Delay
% The *AWGN Channel with Frequency Offset and Variable Delay* subsystem
% first applies the frequency offset and a preset phase offset to the
% transmit signal. Then it adds a variable delay with a choice of the
% following two types of delay to the signal:
%
% * *Ramp delay* - This type of delay is initialized at _DelayStart_
% samples, and increases linearly at a rate of _DelayStep_ samples in each
% frame. When the actual delay reaches one frame, the delay buffer is full,
% and it maintains a delay of one frame.
% * *Triangle delay* - This type of delay linearly changes back and forth
% between _MinDelay_ samples and _MaxDelay_ samples at a rate of
% _DelayStep_ samples in each frame
%
% The use of multiple delay characteristics allows you to investigate their
% effects on receiver performance, particularly on the *Symbol
% Synchronizer* block. The delayed signal is processed through an *AWGN
% Channel*. The diagram of the *AWGN Channel with Frequency Offset and
% Variable Delay* subsystem is as shown in the following.
%
close_system([modelname '/Transmitter/Bit Generation']);
open_system([modelname '/AWGN Channel with Frequency Offset & Variable Time Delay']);
%% Receiver
%% Raised Cosine Receive Filter
% The *Raised Cosine Receive Filter* provides matched filtering for the
% transmitted waveform with a rolloff factor of 0.5.
%% AGC
% The received signal amplitude affects the accuracy of the carrier and
% symbol synchronizer. Therefore the signal amplitude should be stabilized
% to ensure an optimum loop design. The AGC output power is set to a value
% ensuring that the equivalent gains of the phase and timing error
% detectors keep constant over time. The AGC is placed before the *Raised
% Cosine Receive Filter* so that the signal amplitude can be measured with
% an oversampling factor of two, thus improving the accuracy of the
% estimate. You can refer to Chapter 7.2.2 and Chapter 8.4.1 of [ <#22 1> ]
% for details on how to design the phase detector gain.
%% Coarse Frequency Compensation
% The *Coarse Frequency Compensation* subsystem corrects the input signal
% with a rough estimate of the frequency offset.  The following diagram
% shows the subsystem, in which the frequency offset is estimated by
% averaging the output of the correlation-based algorithm of the *Coarse
% Frequency Compensator* block. The compensation is performed by the
% Phase/Frequency Offset block. There is usually a residual frequency
% offset even after the coarse frequency compensation, which would cause a
% slow rotation of the constellation.  The *Carrier Synchronizer* block
% compensates for this residual frequency.
%
% The accuracy of the *Coarse Frequency Compensator* decreases with its
% maximum frequency offset value. Ideally, this value should be set just
% above the expected frequency offset range. For example, this model
% introduces a 5 kHz frequency offset and the *Coarse Frequency
% Compensator* is configured with a 6 kHz maximum frequency offset.

open_system([modelname '/Receiver/Coarse Frequency Compensation']);
%% Symbol Synchronizer
% The timing recovery is performed by a *Symbol Synchronizer* library
% block, which implements a PLL, described in Chapter 8 of [ <#22 1> ], to
% correct the timing error in the received signal. The timing error
% detector is estimated using the Gardner algorithm, which is rotationally
% invariant. In other words, this algorithm can be used before or after
% frequency offset compensation. The input to the block is oversampled by
% two. On average, the block generates one output symbol for every two
% input samples. However, when the channel timing error (delay) reaches
% symbol boundaries, there will be one extra or missing symbol in the
% output frame. In that case, the block implements bit stuffing/skipping
% thus the output of this block is a variable-size signal.
%
% The _Damping factor_, _Normalized loop bandwidth_, and _Detector gain_
% parameters of the block are tunable. Their default values are set to 1
% (critical damping), 0.01 and 5.4 respectively, so that the PLL quickly
% locks to the correct timing while introducing little timing jitter.
%% Carrier Synchronizer
% The fine frequency compensation is performed by a *Carrier Synchronizer*
% library block, which implements a phase-locked loop (PLL), described in
% Chapter 7 of [ <#22 1> ], to track the residual frequency offset and the
% phase offset in the input signal. The PLL uses a Direct Digital
% Synthesizer (DDS) to generate the compensating phase that offsets the
% residual frequency and phase offsets. The phase offset estimate from DDS
% is the integral of the phase error output of a Loop Filter.
%
% The _Damping factor_ and _Normalized loop bandwidth_ parameters of the
% block are tunable. Their default values are set to 1 (critical damping)
% and 0.01 respectively, so that the PLL quickly locks to the intended
% phase while introducing little phase noise.
%% Preamble Detector and Frame Synchronizer
% The location of the known frame header is detected by a *Preamble
% Detector* library block and the frame synchronization is performed by a
% MATLAB System block using a *FrameSynchronizer* System object(TM). The
% Preamble Detector block uses the known frame header (QPSK-modulated
% Barker code) to correlate against the received QPSK symbols in order to
% find the location of the frame header. The Frame Synchronizer block uses
% this location information to align the frame boundaries. It also
% transforms the variable-size output of the *Symbol Synchronizer* block
% into a fixed-size frame, which is necessary for the downstream
% processing. The second output of the block is a boolean scalar indicating
% if the first output is a valid frame with the desired header and if so,
% enables the *Data Decoding* subsystem to run.
%% Data Decoding
% The *Data Decoding* enabled subsystem performs phase ambiguity
% resolution, demodulation and text message decoding. The *Carrier
% Synchronizer* block may lock to the unmodulated carrier with a phase
% shift of 0, 90, 180, or 270 degrees, which can cause a phase ambiguity.
% For details of phase ambiguity and its resolution, please refer to
% Chapter 7.2.2 and 7.7 in [ <#22 1> ]. The *Phase Offset Estimator*
% subsystem determines this phase shift. The *Phase Ambiguity Correction &
% Demodulation* subsystem rotates the input signal by the estimated phase
% offset and demodulates the corrected data. The payload bits are
% descrambled, and printed out to the Simulink Diagnostic Viewer at the end
% of the simulation.

%% Exploring the Example
% The example allows you to experiment with multiple system capabilities to
% examine their effect on bit error rate performance. For example, you can
% view the effect of changing the frequency offset, delay type and
% $E_b/N_0$ on the various displays.
%
% This example models a static frequency offset. In practice, the frequency
% offset might vary over time. This model can still track a time-varying
% frequency drift via the *Coarse Frequency Compensation* subsystem. If the
% actual frequency offset exceeds the maximum frequency offset that can be
% tracked by the current coarse frequency compensation subsystem, you can
% increase its tracking range by increasing the oversampling factor.
% Alternatively, you can change the algorithm from correlation-based to
% FFT-based, in the *Model Parameters* block. The FFT-based algorithm
% performs better than the correlation-based algorithm at low Eb/No.
%
% You can also tune the _Normalized loop bandwidth_ and _Damping factor_
% parameters of the *Symbol Synchronizer* and *Carrier Synchronizer*
% blocks, to assess their convergence time and estimation accuracy. In
% addition, you can assess the pull-in range of the *Carrier Synchronizer*
% block. With a large _Normalized loop bandwidth_ and _Damping factor_, the
% PLL can acquire over a greater frequency offset range. However a large
% _Normalized loop bandwidth_ allows more noise, which leads to a large
% mean squared error in the phase estimation. "Underdamped systems (with
% Damping Factor less than one) have a fast settling time, but exhibit
% overshoot and oscillation; overdamped systems (with Damping Factor
% greater than one) have a slow settling time but no oscillations." [ <#22
% 1> ]. For more detail on the design of these PLL parameters, you can
% refer to Appendix C in [ <#22 1> ].
