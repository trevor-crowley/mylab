TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.508 ns between design_1_wrapper_i/design_1_i/mandelbrot_frame_0/inst/mandelbrot_frame_cud_U2/mandelbrot_frame_cud_DSP48_0_U/p/CLK (clocked by clk_ap_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0) and design_1_wrapper_i/design_1_i/mandelbrot_frame_0/inst/tmp_9_reg_968_reg[0]/D (clocked by clk_ap_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.642 ns between design_1_wrapper_i/design_1_i/mandelbrot_frame_0/inst/mandelbrot_frame_cud_U2/mandelbrot_frame_cud_DSP48_0_U/p/CLK (clocked by clk_ap_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0) and design_1_wrapper_i/design_1_i/mandelbrot_frame_0/inst/tmp_9_reg_968_reg[1]/D (clocked by clk_ap_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.658 ns between design_1_wrapper_i/design_1_i/mandelbrot_frame_0/inst/mandelbrot_frame_cud_U2/mandelbrot_frame_cud_DSP48_0_U/p/CLK (clocked by clk_ap_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0) and design_1_wrapper_i/design_1_i/mandelbrot_frame_0/inst/tmp_9_reg_968_reg[3]/D (clocked by clk_ap_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
